# Stock Analysis Project
I worked on this project from `11/13/22` to `11/20/22`. It was an introduction project to Python, MongoDB, web scraping, and cloud applications.

The basis of this project was creating a process to analyzing stocks based on their fundamentals and past analysts.

The files for this project are all here (including a simple Discord bot), besides those involved with scraping in order to protect site privacy.
