Introduction project to `Python, MongoDB, web scraping, and cloud applications`.

The basis of this project was creating a process to analyzing stocks based on their fundamentals and past analysts.

**NOTE**: The files for this project are all here, besides those involved with scraping in order to protect site privacy. More specifics on the data scraping, algorithms, and all other parts of this project are all in  [this paper](https://github.com/johnsfarrell/analysis-proj/blob/master/Written%20Explanation.pdf).
