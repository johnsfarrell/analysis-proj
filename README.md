# Stock Analysis Project
*11/13/22 to 11/20/22*

Fun side-project to get comfortable with `Python, MongoDB, web scraping, and cloud applications`.

The basis of this project was analyzing stocks based on their fundamentals and past analyses. Scrapers were excluded from this repo to protect the privacy of sites scraped during this project. More specifics on the data scraping, algorithms, and all other parts of this project are [here](https://github.com/johnsfarrell/analysis-proj/blob/master/Written%20Explanation.pdf).
